**M**odelling **U**ser **I**nterface for **OG**-Core and **O**SeMOSYS

The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has applied open-source modelling tools during the last decade in more than 20 countries —particularly in Small Island Developing States, Land-Locked Countries, and Least Developed Countries— to support policies related to Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), climate adaptation, social protection, and fiscal sustainability:
- CLEWS, built on OSeMOSYS, analyzes interactions and trade-offs across land, energy, and water systems under climate scenarios.
- OG-Core is a dynamic overlapping-generations macroeconomic model that evaluates long-term fiscal, demographic, and economic policies.

By linking sectoral resource systems (climate, land, energy, and water) with a dynamic macroeconomic model, the unified framework will allow policymakers to assess both the physical feasibility and economy-wide impacts of climate and development policies in a transparent, reproducible, and low-cost way.

The project will create a standardized interface and shared execution system linking the two models, enabling integrated analyses that are not currently possible. The enhanced OG-CLEWS framework will be deployed in more than 10 countries, supporting evidence-based policymaking and helping countries advance toward their Sustainable Development Goals through 2030.

See the [Project Background & Vision](https://github.com/EAPD-DRB/MUIOGO/wiki/Project-Background-and-Vision) and the programme's [Timeline](https://github.com/EAPD-DRB/MUIOGO/wiki/Timeline) for more information.

MUIOGO is the integration project to bring the purely Python-based OG-Core model into MUIO, the GUI for OSeMOSYS (CLEWS).

At the moment, this repository starts from a direct copy baseline of MUIO. The goal of MUIOGO is to evolve that baseline into an integrated OG-CLEWS model that is maintainable and platform-independent.

## Requirements

- Git:
  - Install: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
